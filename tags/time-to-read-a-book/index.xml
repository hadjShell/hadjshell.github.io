      <description>Intro As a undergraduate who majors in computer science, I was focusing on learning prgramming languages, popular frameworks, university or online lectures in the last three years.

Therefore, most of the books that I read in this period can be categorised into so-called &amp;ldquo;tool-books&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;textbooks&amp;rdquo;.</description>
